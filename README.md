# BMRCalculator
This is a simple BMR calculator that was created using React and Material-UI.

The goal of this project was to create a simple, yet useful, application, so that I could practice deployment via Docker and AWS.

The BMR calculator is using the Mifflin-St Jeor equation to calculate your daily BMR.
